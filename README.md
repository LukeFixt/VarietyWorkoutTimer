# Variety Workout Timer
Create exercises, grouped by muscles/type, and shuffle them through-out each workout session.

## Makes for a less boring workout
I don't enjoy doing the same excercise each session - this keeps it "fresh". Current workout app does this, and is great - but costs money. I think I can make my own, the way I would like it to work (more excercises to pick from). And it's a good step back into development after a year or two hiatus - just a lil thing on the side for fun.
